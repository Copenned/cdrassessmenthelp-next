     The greatest error one can make when creating CDR is forgetting to include all of the information required to correctly assess. A report 
     that is inadequately drafted may damage the application for an Australian Skilled Migration visa.
     In the career episodes, one must discuss your engineering work or all of those projects in depth while keeping in mind what EA wants.    
     Remember, they are seeking to determine your talents and profile; therefore, you should project your professional profile with prudence. 
     Avoid supplying extraneous information since it complicates the evaluation process and may result in CDR rejection.
     For the Career episodes, the essay format is necessary. Avoid utilizing bullet points and stick to the 1000â€“2500-word limit for each career 
     episode. Within that word limit, try to incorporate all of the important material requested by Engineers Australia.
     It would be useful to include the project's issue statements and the measures you took to tackle the problem in your career episode report. 
     It  will help you better define your contributions to the project.
     The career episodes illustrate your application of engineering knowledge and abilities within the selected engineering subject. It is where  
     you discuss your project or challenge, how you solved it, and the outcomes. Additional computations can be provided if necessary. Tables, 
     charts, and computations in excess, on the other hand, will not be accepted and will result in CDR rejection.
     The simplest approach to prevent making mistakes is to familiarize yourself with the EA standards. These have been set up to help you 
     write your CDR report. You may even employ an expert for CDR reviewing and ensure that you do not make any blunders. Getting competent 
     help will guarantee that your CDR is a success.
     While having certain technical elements in your report is permissible, incorporating too many technical aspects in your CDR report raises 
     your chances of CDR rejection. Avoid using too many tables, figures, charts, or images in your CDR report, because they will damage it 
     greatly.
     Plagiarism is the most common reason for project or application rejection or failure, regardless of the kind. Never plagiarize samples from   
     the internet. Even if done accidentally, it might be grounds for dismissal. Because the CDR report is meant to be unique, you should do your 
     best to personalize it to your profile and initiatives. You can always employ the help of a professional writing service and CDR reviewing 
     Service to help you write a plagiarism-free CDR report. Plagiarism is a felony, so remember that.

Each Career Episode report writing must be written in Australian English in your own words. However, knowing English, or even 
Australian English, is  insufficient. Career Episodes report writing should always be in the first person and the active voice. In general, 
you should begin your statements with the word 'I.' For example, 'I created,' 'I researched,' 'I examined,' and so on.

Every incident of your career episode report writing must clearly illustrate the application of engineering knowledge and abilities in 
the selected occupation, stating what you did and describing how you did it, stressing your participation in the incident.

Career episodes report must be written in essay format, but the technical portions should be narrative rather than giving the 
mathematical calculations and the engineering design/fabrication process.

It is critical to number each paragraph in each of your Career Episode reports to provide a reference in the Summary Statement 
Writing. The preferred format is as follows:


Career episode report 1 (paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and so on.)
Career episode report 2 (paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and so on.)
Career episode report 3 (paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and so on.)



The introduction of a Career Episode report should be 
approximately 100 words. It should serve as an opening to 
a particular episode. It 
should include basic information such as:
       Chronology - Dates and duration of the episode.
       Identify the educational institution/organisation where 
       the  experience was achieved.
       The geographical location of your project (city, state, or 
       nation) where you acquired experience.




The introduction should be between 200 and 500 words long. It 
should establish the operational context of the work/study. Its 
purpose is to give a solid context for your professional episode. 
It should provide the following information in the Career Episode 
report writing:
       The nature of the engineering project that you completed.
       Goals of your Project.
       Chart of an organisational structure illustrating your position in 
       the  project's hierarchy during that Career Episode.
       Statement of your responsibilities regarding the project at hand 
       (provide an official duty statement where available).




This section of the Career Episode writing in Australia should 
be between 500 and 1000 words in length. Personal Engineering 
Activity is the primary body of your Career Episode Report. It 
should detail your practical application of engineering ability 
(i.e., you should start writing about your work as an engineer). 
The following information should be included:
       Your specific role in the team.
       How you put your knowledge to use.
       The engineering tasks that were assigned to you.
       How did you complete the task?
       How do you collaborate with other members of your team?
       Any specific technical challenges or problems you faced and 
       how you resolved them.
       You made a significant contribution or devised tactics, 
       including  any original or innovative design work.




       The summary should be between 50 and 100 words and is the final section of your Career Episode Report (CER). It should be a summary 
of the entire event and include the following details:
        A summary of your project.
        Information on whether or not the project's goals/objectives were   
        reached.
        Mention the praise if you got any for the project.
        In the conclusion section, explain how your contribution to the  
        project aided the effort.
